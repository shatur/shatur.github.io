				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was done as a part of our academic curriculum. The motive of the project is to help an individual to monitor air quality around them. So, we have designed an IOT which can detect harmful gasses around its surroundings.<p>

				<h3>Need of Project :</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in Delhi, which is world's most polluted city. We face several problems related to it in our day to day life. So, basically, we want to design a device, which can help an individual to monitor air quality around them.<p>

				<h2><u>Technical Details</u></h2><p>

				<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
					<li>Sensors [MQ135]</li>
					<li>Analog to Digital Converter</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Tech Stack Required</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Java for app develipment</li>
					<li>PHP for server</li>
					<li>Python for controlling GPIO</li>
					<li>Html, Js &amp; CSS for website</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Why Raspberry Pi?</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Raspberry Pi is a full fledged computer. It has a real processor, real RAM, real GPU, similar to what smartphones have these days. It comes with a separate distribution of Linux that can run on it as an OS. For this project we have used raspbian OS, which is quite easy to use. It can run apps, play videos, listen to music on it. It outputs to a monitor and takes input from a mouse and a keyboard. It also provides GPIO pins (General Purpose Input Output) that can take inputs and give outputs, in electrical forms.<p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used raspberry pi due to its ease of use. It contained everything which we needed for our project. The coding for controlling GPIO is done in python, which is not hard to learn. Also this was a one-time investment, and raspberry pi can be used in many other experiment projects.<p>

				<h3>About Sensor [MQ135]</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MQ-135 is a hazardous gas sensor used for air quality control and is suitable for detecting NH3 (Ammonia), NOx, alcohol, Benzene, smoke, CO2, etc. You can see data sheet of MQ135 Sensor <a class = "nostyle" href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Sensors/SNS-MQ135/resources/SNS-MQ135.pdf">here.</a><p>

				<h4>Features</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Wide Detecting scope</li>
					<li>Stable and long life</li>
					<li>Fast response and High sensitivity</li>
					<li>Simple drive circuit</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Need of Analog to Digital Converter</h4><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MQ 135 sensor produces output in analog form, so there is a need to convert this analog signal to digital signal. For our project we have used MCP3004 ADC.<p>

				<h3>So whom to choose?</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay so, there are so many open source organizations, so whom to choose. Every organization is unique in their own way.  Every organization's technical need is different, so it will also depend on your skill-set. You have to do some research by yourself. Choosing organization depends solely on you. But rest assured, work culture is same, they always welcome new contributors.<p>

				<h3>What have I learned while contributing?</h3><p>

				To name a few things which I have learned while contributing to Mozilla are:<p>
				<ul class = "anchor-style">
					<li><a class = "nostyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version Control</a></li>
					<li><a class = "nostyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_relay_chat">IRC</a></li>
					<li>Build tools.</li>
					<li>Learned a lot programming wise.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Special Thanks to open source maintainers:</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, I want to thank all those people who have made my experience in FOSS world so amazing and wonderful. Keep it up guys, you are really making world a better place.<br>
